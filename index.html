					<h2>Factory Acceptance Testing</h2>
					
					<p>The GC2 secure facility has been specifically designed for show piecing integrated security systems with equipment pre-build workshops, server rooms, workshops and an upper level conference control room and conference room.</p>
					
					<p>Our in-house engineers can assemble and test a wide range of equipment to ensure quality before deployment. A strictly managed procedure for pre-build and test documentation ensures that each unit is built to the same high standard of workmanship, quality and is rigorously tested before being packed for shipping.</p>
					
					<p>All prebuild equipment is logged within our test procedures to capture make, model and serial numbers for control and tractability with a test certificate being produced to verify that the equipment / system has been fully tested. This process goes a long way to ensuring that the system will be installed and commissioned with minimal disruption to the site or customer.</p>
